### `POST /cages/{id}/fish-estimates` 🟢
Submit a new quarterly fish estimate for the cage. Resubmissions within the same quarter are allowed.

**Server-side behaviour on each submission:**
1. Determine `revision = MAX(revision) + 1` across **all** existing rows (regardless of status) for the given (cage, year, quarter), defaulting to `1` if no previous estimates exist. Computing across all statuses ensures the revision number never restarts even if prior revisions were approved, rejected, or superseded.
2. Automatically mark all existing `pending` estimates for the same (cage, year, quarter) as `superseded` (Rule B). A `superseded` audit-log entry is written for each affected estimate.
3. Insert the new row with `status = pending` and the computed `revision`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "year": 2025,
  "quarter": 3,
  "estimated_count": 13000,
  "notes": "Sample count from net test on July 15."
}
```

**Response `201`:** Created estimate object.
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "cage_id": "uuid",
  "year": 2025,
  "quarter": 3,
  "revision": 1,
  "estimated_count": 13000,
  "notes": "Sample count from net test on July 15.",
  "status": "pending",
  "submitted_by": { "id": "uuid", "full_name": "Ana" },
  "submitted_at": "2025-10-01T08:00:00Z",
